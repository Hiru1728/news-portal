                <p>The scope of a var variable is functional scope.It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.It
                    can be declared without initialization.It can be accessed without initialization as its default
                    value is “undefined”.</p>
                <h5>Let</h5>
                <p>The scope of a let variable is block scope.It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the
                    scope.It can be declared without initialization.It cannot be accessed without initialization
                    otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.</p>
                <h5>Const</h5>
                <p>The scope of a const variable is block scope.It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.It
                    cannot be declared without initialization.It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot
                    be declared without initialization.</p>

                <h1>Difference Between Arrow Function and Regular Function</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced in ES6 that
                    is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular JavaScript functions and
                    arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are some differences between them. Let's see the
                    differences below: -

                <ol>
                    <li>Syntax</li>
                    <li>Arguments binding</li>
                    <li>Use of this keyword</li>
                    <li>Using a new keyword</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <h4>1)Syntax</h4>
                <p>
                    A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow
                    functions. </p>
                <h4>2) Arguments binding</h4>
                <p>arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments.The arrow function, on
                    the opposite, doesn’t define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments binding.</p>
                <h4>3) Use of this keyword</h4>
                <p>Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the
                    value of this depends on how the function is invoked.The behavior of this inside of an arrow,
                    function differs considerably from the regular function’s this behavior as an arrow function does
                    not have its own “this” keyword.</p>
                <h4>4) Using a new keyword</h4>
                <p>Regular functions are constructible and callable. They can be called using the new keyword.But, the
                    arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be used as
                    constructor functions.</p>

                <h1>Difference between map,forEach filter and find in javascript</h1>
                <hr>
                <h4>map</h4>
                <p>.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
                    elements.</p>
                <h4>forEach</h4>
                <p>.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the
                    array and it returns undefined.</p>
                <h4>filter</h4>
                <p>.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new
                    array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
                <h4>find</h4>
                <p>Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail —
                    this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the
                    function will return the first that has matched.</p>
